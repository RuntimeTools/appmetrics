## Raising issues

Please raise any bug reports on the relevant project's issue tracker. Be sure to
search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were
trying to do and what went wrong.

Provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

## Feature requests

For feature requests, please raise a Github [issue](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/issues).

## Pull-Requests

If you want to raise a pull-request with a new feature, or a refactoring
of existing code, it may well get rejected if you haven't discussed it in
a Github [issue](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/issues).
