## Raising bug reports and feature requests

Please raise any bug reports and feature requests on the project's GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/runtimetools/appmetrics/issues).
Be sure to search the list of open and closed issues to see if your problem or request has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

## Pull requests

Please do this by adding your name to the [AUTHORS file](https://github.com/runtimetools/appmetrics/blob/master/AUTHORS.md)

If you want to raise a pull-request for a bug fix or a new feature, we recommend that you raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/runtimetools/appmetrics/issues) to discuss it first.
