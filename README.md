Node Application Metrics instruments the Node.js runtime for performance monitoring, providing the monitoring data via an API.
Additionally the data can be visualized by using the [Node Application Metrics Dashboard](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics-dash).

The data can also be visualized in Eclipse using the [IBM Monitoring and Diagnostics Tools - Health Center][1] client. Profiling data is available in Health Center, but is not yet available in the Dashboard. See https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/healthcenter/ for more details.

## Performance overhead

Our testing has shown that the performance overhead in terms of processing is minimal, adding less than 0.5 % to the CPU usage of your application. The additional memory required is around 20 MB to gather information about your system and application.

We gathered this information by monitoring the sample application [Acme Air][3]. We used MongoDB as our datastore and used JMeter to drive load though the program.  We have performed this testing with Node.js version 6.10.3

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites:

Appmetrics uses `node-gyp` to compile and build local binary libraries to enhance execution performance. If the following compilation and build logs contain errors, make sure you have the node-gyp pre-requisites installed \(https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation). If you have them and the build still had errors, see if there are any related issues at https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/issues). If there aren\'t, feel free to open a new issue to report the bug.

### Installation

You can get Node Application Metrics from 3 different places:

  * npmjs.org (install by running `npm install appmetrics`. Native libraries are prebuilt)
  * Github ([install from source](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/wiki/Install-direct-from-github-source) by cloning the git repository. Requires a compiler)
  * [IBM SDK for Node.js](https://developer.ibm.com/node/sdk/) (packaged with the SDK, native libraries are prebuilt)

### Configuring Node Application Metrics

Node Application Metrics can be configured in two ways, by using the configuration file described below or via a call to configure(options).

Node Application Metrics comes with a configuration file inside the [module installation directory](#installation) (`.../node_modules/appmetrics/appmetrics.properties`). This can be used to configure connection options, logging and data source options.

Node Application Metrics will attempt to load `appmetrics.properties` from one of the following locations (in order):

1. the application directory
2. the current working directory
3. the appmetrics module installation directory

The default configuration has minimal logging enabled, will attempt to send data to a local MQTT server on the default port and has method profiling disabled.

Many of the options provide configuration of the Health Center core agent library and are documented in the Health Center documentation: [Health Center configuration properties](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3KLZ/com.ibm.java.diagnostics.healthcenter.doc/topics/configproperties.html).

The following options are specific to appmetrics:

* `com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.data.profiling=[off|on]`
  Specifies whether method profiling data will be captured. The default value is `off`.  This specifies the value at start-up; it can be enabled and disabled dynamically as the application runs, either by a monitoring client or the API.

## Running Node Application Metrics

### Preloading appmetrics
In previous versions appmetrics came with an executable, `node-hc`, which could be used instead of the `node` command to run your application and load and start appmetrics. This has been removed in version 4.0.0, instead you can use:

```sh
$ node --require appmetrics/start app.js
```
to preload and start appmetrics, or in Node.js from versions 8.0.0 and 6.12.0 onwards, use the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable:

```sh
$ export NODE_OPTIONS="--require appmetrics/start"
```

### Modifying your application to use appmetrics
If you [locally install](#installation) this module with npm then you will additionally have access to the monitoring data via the `appmetrics` API (see *[API Documentation](#api-documentation)*).

To load `appmetrics` and get the monitoring API object, add the following to the start-up code for your application:
```js
var appmetrics = require('appmetrics');
var monitoring = appmetrics.monitor();
```
The call to `appmetrics.monitor()` starts the data collection agent, making the data available via the API and to the Heath Center client via MQTT.

You should start your application using the `node` command as usual (**not** `node-hc`).

You must call `require('appmetrics');` *before* the require statements for any npm modules you want to monitor. Appmetrics must be initialized first so that it can instrument modules for monitoring as they are loaded. If this is a problem due to the structure of your application you can require the module on the node command line by using -r or --require or by setting NODE_OPTIONS as described above to make sure it is pre-loaded.

Once you have loaded appmetrics you can then use the monitoring object to register callbacks and request information about the application:
```js
monitoring.on('initialized', function (env) {
    env = monitoring.getEnvironment();
    for (var entry in env) {
        console.log(entry + ':' + env[entry]);
    };
});

monitoring.on('cpu', function (cpu) {
    console.log('[' + new Date(cpu.time) + '] CPU: ' + cpu.process);
});
```

## Health Center Eclipse IDE client
**_Not supported on z/OS_**
### Connecting to the client

Connecting to the Health Center client requires the additional installation of a MQTT broker. The Node Application Metrics agent sends data to the MQTT broker specified in the `appmetrics.properties` file or set via a call to configure(options). Installation and configuration documentation for the Health Center client is available from the [Health Center documentation in IBM Knowledge Center][2].

Note that both the API and the Health Center client can be used at the same time and will receive the same data. Use of the API requires a local install and application modification (see *[Modifying your application to use the local installation](#modifying-your-application-to-use-the-local-installation)*).

Further information regarding the use of the Health Center client with Node Application Metrics can be found on the [appmetrics wiki][3]: [Using Node Application Metrics with the Health Center client](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/wiki/Using-Node-Application-Metrics-with-the-Health-Center-client).

    * `time` (Number) the milliseconds when the request occurred. This can be converted to a Date using `new Date(data.time)`.
    * `type` (String) The type of the request event. This is the name of the probe that sent the request data, e.g. `http`, `socketio` etc.
    * `name` (String) The name of the request event. This is the request task, eg. the url, or the method being used.
    * `request` (Object) the detailed data for the root request event:
        * `type` (String) The type of the request event. This is the name of the probe that sent the request data, e.g. `http`, `socketio` etc.
        * `name` (String) The name of the request event. This is the request task, eg. the url, or the method being used.
        * `context` (Object) Additional context data (usually contains the same data as the associated non-request metric event).
        * `stack` (String) An optional stack trace for the event call.
        * `children` (Array) An array of child request events that occurred as part of the overall request event. Child request events may include function trace entries, which will have a `type` of null.
        * `duration` (Number) the time taken for the request to complete in ms.
    * `duration` (Number) the time taken for the overall request to complete in ms.

## Troubleshooting
Find below some possible problem scenarios and corresponding diagnostic steps. Updates to troubleshooting information will be made available on the [appmetrics wiki][3]: [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/appmetrics/wiki/Troubleshooting). If these resources do not help you resolve the issue, you can open an issue on the Node Application Metrics [appmetrics issue tracker][5].

### Checking Node Application Metrics has started
By default, a message similar to the following will be written to console output when Node Application Metrics starts:

`[Fri Aug 21 09:36:58 2015] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.loader INFO: Node Application Metrics 1.0.1-201508210934 (Agent Core 3.0.5.201508210934)`

### Error "The specified module could not be found ... appmetrics.node"
This error indicates there was a problem while loading the native part of the module or one of its dependent libraries. On Windows, `appmetrics.node` depends on a particular version of the C runtime library and if it cannot be found this error is the likely result.

Check:

* Does the `appmetrics.node` file exist in the indicated location? If not, try reinstalling the module.
* For version `1.0.0` on Windows: are `msvcr100.dll` and `msvcp100.dll` installed on your Windows system, and do they match the bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) of your Node.js runtime environment? If not, you may be able to install them with the *Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2010* package from the Microsoft website.
* For version `1.0.1` on Windows: does `msvcr120.dll` and `msvcp120.dll` exist in the module installation directory (see *[Installation](#install)*) and does it match the bitness of your Node.js runtime environment? If not, try reinstalling the module.

Note: On Windows, the global module installation directory might be shared between multiple Node.js runtime environments. This can cause problems with globally installed modules with native components, particularly if some of the Node.js runtime environments are 32-bit and others are 64-bit because the native components will only work with those with matching bitness.

### Error "Failed to open library .../libagentcore.so: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found"
This error indicates there was a problem while loading the native part of the module or one of its dependent libraries. On non-Windows platforms, `libagentcore.so` depends on a particular (minimum) version of the C runtime library and if it cannot be found this error is the result.

Check:

* Your system has the required version of `libstdc++` installed. You may need to install or update a package in your package manager. If your OS does not supply a package at this version, you may have to install standalone software - consult the documentation or support forums for your OS.
* If you have an appropriate version of `libstdc++`installed, ensure it is on the system library path, or use a method (such as setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux, or LIBPATH environment variable on AIX) to add the library to the search path.

### No profiling data present for Node.js applications
Method profiling data is not collected by default, check *[Configuring Node Application Metrics](#configuring-node-application-metrics)* for information on how to enable it.

If collection is enabled, an absence of method profiling data from a Node.js application could be caused by the type of tasks that are being run by your application -- it may be running long, synchronous tasks that prevent collection events from being scheduled on the event loop.

If a task uses the Node.js thread exclusively then shuts down the Node.js runtime environment, the Health Center agent may not get the opportunity to obtain *any* profiling data. An example of such an application is the Octane JavaScript benchmark suite, which loads the CPU continuously rather than dividing the load across multiple units of work.
